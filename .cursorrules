### Objectives
- Implement secure file sharing functionality with industry-standard encryption
- Create maintainable, well-documented code adhering to security best practices
- Ensure optimal performance while maintaining robust security measures

### Code Style and Architecture
frontend:
  react:
    - Use functional components and hooks exclusively
    - Implement proper state management with Redux
    - Follow container/presenter pattern
    - Use TypeScript for type safety
    - Implement proper error boundaries
    
backend:
  django:
    - Follow Django's MVT architecture strictly
    - Implement proper middleware for security
    - Use Django REST Framework best practices
    - Maintain clear service layer separation
    - Implement comprehensive logging

### Security Best Practices
encryption:
  - Implement AES-256 encryption correctly
  - Use secure key management
  - Implement proper IV handling
  - Use secure random number generation

authentication:
  - Implement MFA properly
  - Use secure session management
  - Implement proper password policies
  - Use secure token handling

### Testing Requirements
frontend_testing:
